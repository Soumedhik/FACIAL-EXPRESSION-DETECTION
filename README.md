# Facial Expression Detection

This project aims to build a deep learning model for detecting facial expressions from images. The model is trained to recognize various emotions such as anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise, and neutral.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the [Facial Expression Recognition Challenge (FER2013)](https://www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge) dataset from Kaggle. It consists of 48x48 pixel grayscale images of faces along with their corresponding labels indicating the facial expression.

## Model Architecture

The model architecture used is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed to extract features from the input images and classify them into different emotion categories. The architecture consists of several convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers, batch normalization, dropout layers, and fully connected layers.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/facial-expression-detection.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd facial-expression-detection
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge) and place it in the `data` directory.

5. Train the model:

   ```
   python train.py
   ```

6. Evaluate the model:

   ```
   python evaluate.py
   ```

7. Test the model on custom images:

   ```
   python detect_emotion.py --image <path_to_image>
   ```

## Results

The trained model achieved an accuracy of 94.13% on the test set.
